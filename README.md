# Terminal based todo app written in Rust

Just a todo app quickly thrown together using the language Rust and the crates [termion](https://github.com/redox-os/termion) and [term_cursor](https://github.com/Lisoph/term_cursor).

It isn't done yet, but most of the functionality is implemented.

### Features

Nothing really, except the following:

+ Somewhat adapts to the terminal size.
+ Saves the todo list in a file called `todo_list`.

### Still some things to do

Including:

+ [ ] React immediately on terminal resize (and adapt accordingly)
+ [ ] Implement the ability to type just `add <something>` to add something (same for remove)
+ [ ] Add some nice colors (?)
